The folder consists of the .py file for planning algorithm and the video to show the out example
I was not able to record the video through screen because of some pygame issue, so I had to record it by phone

The code takes ~15 sec to define the obstacle and ~7 sec to find the last node (400,250).

How to run the code:
Copy the Dijkstra_pathplanning_Rishabh_Singh.py to your desired location
Open the .py file in any text editor (VSC is preferrable)

Libraries required are:
numpy - pip3 install numpy
queue - pip3 install queue
pygame - pip3 install pygame
matplotlib - pip3 install matplotlib
cv2 - pip3 install cv2 


type running command on the command terminal: python3 Dijkstra_pathplanning_Rishabh_Singh.py


Sample commands to run the program:
python3 dijkstra_search_it4.py 

Expected input:
please enter the starting x coordinate from 1-400: 1
please enter the starting x coordinate from 1-250: 1
please enter the goal x coordinate from 1-400: 400
please enter the goal y coordinate from 1-250: 250
